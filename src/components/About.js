      <p>
        An alcoholic beverage made by distilling a fermented mix of grains,
        <br />
        fruit or vegetables, liquor encompasses a variety of styles, so there's
        something for <br />
        everybody. Generally, liquor falls into six broad categories, including
        brandy, gin, whiskey, vodka,
        <br />
        tequila and rum. Depending on the type, alcohol by volume (ABV) ranges
